[This handout](handout1.pdf) shows a parallel corpus
between two alien languages. You'll use this data to translate some
alien words and sentences.

1. Try to draw lines between the words that are translations of each
other. Start out by finding words that occur in multiple source sentences,
like "ghirok", and see if you can find words that appear in all of the
corresponding target sentences. Do you notice any patterns in how the
words translate? Do you think that the prefix "ok-" corresponds to something?
*You do not have to turn anything in for this step.*

2. Log in to the class Linux server using your netid.
`ssh yourNetID@ling506.atlas.illinois.edu`

3. Follow [these instructions](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) to set up your .gitconfig file.

4. Go to the [class Github page](https://github.com/2015-Spring-UIUC-LING506) and follow the link for `yourGithubUsername-hw0`

5. Clone your HW0 repository to the class Linux server.
`git clone https://github.com/2015-Spring-UIUC-LING506/yourGithubUsername-hw0.git`

6. Follow the instructions in the HW0 README

7. As you work, check in your changes using `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`
