Term Project <span class="text-muted">The Ultimate Challenge</span>
=============================================================

Your term project is to design a homework assignment for next year’s class.  You project will consist of the following components:

1. A description of the problem, similar to the descriptions on the HW assignments
1. A collection of data used to train a model, tune its parameters, and/or evaluate its performance
1. A scoring script that implements an objective function that will allow us to score submissions on the leaderboard
1. An implementation of the simplest possible baseline, along with commented sample code
1. An implementation of a published baseline, along with commented sample code that removes the parts that students should implement
1. If you work in a team: One extension that attempts improve on the baseline per team member, along with a 1 paragraph writeup describing each extension and whether it worked.

You should identify what topic you would like to work on, and then email your instructor or schedule a meeting to go over the details.  Here are some ideas of topics that you could use for your final project: 

* Sentence alignment
* Language identification
* Transliteration
* Feature engineering for discriminative word alignment
* Language modelling
* Predict the right translation given a context
* Phrase pair extraction
* SCFG rule extraction
* Implement the CKY algorithm for decoding SCFGs
* Chinese word segmentation
* System combination
* Domain adaptation
* Lexicalized re-ordering
* Clause re-structring for better re-ordering
* Mining parallel documents from Common Crawl
* Extracting parallel sentences from Wikipedia
* Monolingual text-to-text generation 
* Predicting the goodness of translation without references
* Crowdsourcing translation
* Minimum Bayes risk re-ranking

You are welcome to choose your own topic, provided that it is related to machine translation.

## Milestones and Due Dates
* February 27 - term project assigned
* During Spring break (March 8-16) - Select your term project topic and email your instructor to say what you’ve selected
* March 18 - draft write-up is due.  Your write-up should include 
1. A problem definition
1. A pointer to or more more papers or sections textbook that describes the problem
1. What objective functions you are considering
1. What type of data you will need to evaluate
* March 27 - HW4 is due
* March 27 - your data must be collected and submitted
* April 1 - revised write-up is due, taking into account any feedback from instructor and TA
* April 3 - objective function must be implemented (it is OK to use an existing implementation if you need to)
* April 8 - your default system is due
* April 10 - your baseline system is due
* April 15 - your completed project is due (final writeup, data, objective fn, default system, and baseline system).  It Will be published on the class web site, and used as the final homework for other students.
* April 17 - HW5 assigned: do one of the other student’s term projects
* April 29 - HW5 due: turn in your implementation of another student’s term project
* final exam date - *extra credit* implement one or more extensions beyond your own baseline, or do one or more of the new student-written HWs.
